# okwach-01-Final-KCB-AICE-course-project
This repository contains my final project for a Data Science and AI course, focusing on predicting machine failures using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset was uploaded from Kaggle datasets(the link was mistakenly misplaced though searching "machine failures"can land the dataset on Kaggle).
